    # Step 1: Parse Python Repositories
    # - Load the target Python repositories.
    # - Use the `ast` module to parse each file and extract structural elements 
    #   like modules, classes, methods, and functions.

    # Step 2: Build the Graph
    # - Represent each code element as a node (module, class, method, function).
    # - Create edges based on relationships (e.g., imports, inheritance, function calls, memberships).
    # - Use a graph library like NetworkX or store in a graph database like Neo4j.

    # Step 3: Generate Natural Language Annotations (NLAs)
    # - For each node in the graph, generate descriptive annotations using an LLM.
    # - Store annotations with the corresponding nodes in the graph.

    # Step 4: Implement Retrieval Mechanism
    # - Process user queries to identify relevant parts of the graph.
    # - Traverse the graph to retrieve the most relevant code snippets.
    # - Use annotations and relationships to guide the traversal process.

    # Step 5: Evaluate the System
    # - Test the implementation using benchmarks like HumanEval, CoderEval, or SWE-bench.
    # - Measure the accuracy, efficiency, and relevance of code retrieval.

    # Step 6: Optimize and Refine
    # - Analyze evaluation results to identify areas for improvement.
    # - Optimize the graph structure, NLAs, and retrieval algorithms.
    # - Extend to more complex or diverse codebases if needed.
